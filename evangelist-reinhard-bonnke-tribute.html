        <h2>Here's a chronology of Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke's life:</h2>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Born on <strong>19 April 1940</strong> in Königsberg, East Prussia, Germany.</li>
          <!-- <li><strong></strong>Taken with his siblings to Denmark during the evacuation of East Prussia by his mother for a period.</li> -->
          <li>Became a Born-Again Christian at age <strong>9</strong> after his mother preached to him about a sin he had committed. </li>
          <li>At age <strong>10</strong>, young Reinhard discerned the call of God upon his life to serve as a missionary in Africa.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1951</strong>, Reinhard lead his first soul to Christ on a street corner in Glückstadt.</li>
          <li>Reinhard attended the Bible College of Wales founded by Rees Howells.</li>
          <li>Pastored in Germany for <strong>7</strong> years after his graduation.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1964</strong>, Reinhard married his wife Anni and began his family.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1967</strong>, the Bonnkes by the Velberter Missions Board were given a one-year South African apprenticeship with the Apostolic Faith Mission (AFM) which would cover the then Transvaal and also Swaziland.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1968</strong>, Reinhard became the AFM overseer of three small churches serving the indigenous Basuto people in the Kingdom of Lesotho after completing his apprenticeship.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1970</strong>, Reinhard devised an employment plan for the unemployed young men called the Soweto Bicycle Campaign to also spread the Gospel.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1973</strong>, Reinhard had a recurring dream featuring a picture of the map of Africa being splashed and covered with the blood of Jesus and also heard the words "Africa Shall Be Saved".</li>
          <li>In <strong>1974</strong>, Christ for all Nations was formed with headquarters in Johannesburg.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1976</strong>, Reinhard's meetings proved that the rental tents available in South Africa were far too small. The Lord spoke to Reinhard to trust Him for a <em>10,000 seat tent</em> which in trusting God's word was later constructed by a tent maker in Milan.</li>
          <li>With the infux of people, the Holy spirit spoke to Reinhard to trust the Lord for <em>34,000 seat tent</em>.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1984</strong>, the colossal tent was built entirely by CfaN technicians, which according to the Guinness Book of World Records was the largest mobile structure on earth at the time.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1986</strong>, the colossal tent was retired from CfaN ministry due to a larger influx of people and was given to other missions organisations in Africa who use it for evangelisation of the continent.</li>
          <li>The subsequent Gospel Campaigns were conducted in open-air using stadiums or vast open areas that were cleared and set up specifically for the campaigns.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1990</strong>, CfaN's campaign in Kaduna, Nigeria attracted a congregation of <em>500,000 people</em> who gathered to hear the Gospel. CfaN meetings in Kaduna concluded with a total attendance of <em>1,670,000 people</em> which was more than the number they preached to during the entire year of <strong>1987</strong>.</li>
          <li>In <strong>1999</strong>, Reinhard Bonnke and the Christ for all Nations team were invited back into the country by president-elect Olusegun Obasanjo after nine years of forced absence from Nigeria.</li>
          <li>In <strong>October 1999</strong>, Reinhard arrived in Benin City, the capital of Edo State and held a six-day event that was attended by almost <em>2 million people</em> in a city with a population of just <em>800,000 people</em>! <em>396,000 decision cards</em> for salvation were received!</li>
          <li>In <strong>2000</strong>, CfaN held the Fire Conference in Lagos, Nigeria. Over <em>1.6 Million people</em> attended the final night. <em>3,461,171 salvations</em> were recorded and nearly <em>4 million books</em> given out.</li>
          <li>In <strong>2003</strong>, More than <em>7,571,987 souls</em> embraced the saving power of Jesus Christ through CfaN campaigns in Nigeria.</li>
          <li>In <strong>2007</strong>, young Evangelist Daniel Kolenda joined CfaN. After awhile, he started preaching before Reinhard would in some of the campaigns and later preached on some campaigns entirely alone.</li>
          <li>By end of <strong>2011</strong>, CfaN had recorded <em>60,862,305 salvations</em> in Nigeria!!</li>
          <li>Reinhard passed on th baton to Daniel who now serves as the president and CEO of Christ for all Nations. And under his leadership, CfaN is pressing on with a commitment to leverage every technology and opportunity God makes available for the great cause of winning souls.</li>
          <li>Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke won over <strong>80,029,661 Documented souls</strong>  to Christ.</li>
          <li>Went to be with the Lord on <strong>7 December 2019</strong> at age <strong>79</strong></li>
        </ul>
